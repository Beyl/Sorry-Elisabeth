# Sorry Elisabeth

## Immerse yourself into a short horror history

You play as *Elisabeth*, a 16 years old teenager that doesn't know where she woke up. Remembering that you were with **your mom** just before closing your eyes, you need to find out what happened, and how to get out of this mysterious place with her.
**Interact** with the environment, pay attention to **details**, and **resolve the enigmas** to figure out why you have woken up here and find your precious mom.
